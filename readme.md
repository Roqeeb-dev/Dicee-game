# Sumamry

This project is a boss level challenge in the Angela Yu challenge. 

I didn't code the HTML and CSS as it was already there, my challenge was to simply create the game with my basic knowledge of JS. 

To be very honest, I am not too eager to submit this as i didnt complete it myself, I required chatGPT in some parts but i did the majority of the work.

# Update

I just added media queries to enhance the look on smaller screens 

I will try to keep learning JS  and hope to understand it better moving forward. 

Love & Light,
Cynosure.

This project is a boss level challenge in the Angela Yu challenge. I didn't code the HTML and CSS as it was already there, my challenge was to simply create the game with my basic knowledge of JS. To be very honest, I am not too eager to submit this as i didnt complete it myself, I required chatGPT in some parts but i did the majority of the work.
I will try to keep learning JS  and hope to understand it better moving forward. 
Love & Light,
Cynosure.
